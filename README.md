# YTExplorer
YTExplorer is a modern WPF app built with Material Design capable of downloading Youtube videos in MP3, WAV, WEBM and MP4 formats written in C# with the MVVM architecture.

New update soon, and probably port from Material Design to [wpfui](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) by [lepoco](https://github.com/lepoco)
